## readme.txt: 

DOI: 10.17044/scilifelab.21948521


PDM plink files, including 89 unrelated pugs, were used for analyses after QC (--maf 0.01 --geno 0.05 --mind 0.05) and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium was applied with a threshold of 1e-10

## Usage notes from dataset entry (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Pug_dog_thoracolumbar_myelopathy/21948521)
The datasets consist of genotype data from pug dogs in plink format used for the study Multiple genetic loci associated with pug dog thoracolumbar myelopathy.



PDM plink files are:
*   QC:ed (--maf 0.01 --geno 0.05 --mind 0.05 and --hwe 1e-10) 
*   And relatedness filtered at a threshold of 0.177, including 89 dogs of which 51 were affected by pug dog thoracolumbar myelopathy and 38 were unaffected controls.



Genotyping technique is indicated in the FIID column, with GC indicating Gencove low-pass sequenced dogs using Pipeline Dog low pass v2 with 676 dogs in the reference panel and GW indicating genotyped dogs using Illumina 230k CanineHD BeadChip.


Chromosomal coordinates are based on the dog CanFam3.1 genome assembly.
