# Computational modelling of genomic inbreeding and homozygosity islands in extremely small populations
Master Thesis Project about the interplay between inbreeding and artificial selection in extremely small effective populations.
The aim of this project and this repository is to develope a pipeline capable of discerning between these two genomic signatures from one another. 
The pipeline will be including simulations made with the R-package AlphaSimR.
