#This file explains all of the variables in each of the datasets for UK German Shepherd dogs that accompany: 
#Genome-wide association studies for canine hip dysplasia in single and multiple populations â€“ implications and potential novel risk loci.
# S Wang, E Strandberg, P Arvelius, DN Clements, P Wiener, J Friedrich

# the genotypes (Wang_HDGenetDogs_Genotypes_100621_UK.ped) and map (Wang_HDGenetDogs_Genotypes_100621_UK.map) files are in PLINK format
# genotype and map files contain information on the 78,088 autosomal SNPs that passed quality control described in the paper in the UK and Swedish data set
